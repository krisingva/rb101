# Getting Things Done
# We wrote a method for moving a given number of elements from one array to
# another. We decide to test it on our todo list, but invoking move on line 11
# results in a SystemStackError. What does this error mean and why does it
# happen?

def move(n, from_array, to_array)
  to_array << from_array.shift
  move(n - 1, from_array, to_array)
end

# Example

todo = ['study', 'walk the dog', 'coffee with Tom']
done = ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach']

move(2, todo, done)

p todo # should be: ['coffee with Tom']
p done # should be: ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach', 'study', 'walk the dog']

# This program will keep going like an endless loop because the argument n is
# not used in the method to exit the method if equal to 0 or less. The
# Array#shift method will keep going, even if there are no more elements in
# from_array, it will just return `nil` and add that to to_array.
# SystemStackError documentation: Raised in case of a stack overflow. Recursion
# is never-ending.

# Fix:

# def move(n, from_array, to_array)
#   n.times do
#     to_array << from_array.shift
#   end
# end

# LS Solution:
# Approach/Algorithm
# Every recursion needs a base case, i.e. a condition under which it will stop.
# Our method doesn't have one, so it just repeatedly calls itself with ever
# decreasing values for n:

# move(2, ..., ...)
# move(1, ..., ...)
# move(0, ..., ...)
# move(-1, ..., ...)
# move(-2, ..., ...)
# ...
# In order to know where it needs to return to after finishing each of these
# calls, Ruby puts each call on a call stack. Since we never stop, this stack
# keeps growing and growing, until it exceeds its limit. This causes the
# SystemStackError - a real stack overflow!

# In order to fix this, we need to add a condition under which the recursion
# stops.

# Solution
# def move(n, from_array, to_array)
#   return if n == 0
#   to_array << from_array.shift
#   move(n - 1, from_array, to_array)
# end

# # Example

# todo = ['study', 'walk the dog', 'coffee with Tom']
# done = ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach']

# move(2, todo, done)

# p todo #=> ['coffee with Tom']
# p done #=> ['apply sunscreen', 'go to the beach', 'study', 'walk the dog']
# Discussion
# We want to stop as soon as we have moved n elements from one array to the
# other, i.e. when n == 0. The code we have added on line 2 of the solution
# tells Ruby to return from the method when that condition is met.

# Further Exploration
# What happens if the length of the from_array is smaller than n?
# Adds `nil` instead of item.
