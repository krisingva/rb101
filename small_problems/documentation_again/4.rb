# Mandatory Blocks
# The Array#bsearch method is used to search ordered Arrays more quickly than #find and #select can. Assume you have the following code:
a = [1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 19]
# How would you search this Array to find the first element whose value exceeds 8?

# Answer:
p a.bsearch { |x| x > 8 }

# Reference: https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/Array.html#method-i-bsearch
# bsearch {|x| block } â†’ elem
# bsearch stands for binary search
