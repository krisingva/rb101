# Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for
# words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them
# into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

# Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb,
# and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

# Example

# Enter a noun: dog
# Enter a verb: walk
# Enter an adjective: blue
# Enter an adverb: quickly

# Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!

print "Enter a noun: "
noun = gets.chomp
print "Enter a verb: "
verb = gets.chomp
print "Enter an adjective: "
adjective = gets.chomp
print "Enter an adverb: "
adverb = gets.chomp

puts "Do you have to #{verb} your #{adjective} #{noun} #{adverb}? That's a shame!"

# LS:
# Solution
# print 'Enter a noun: '
# noun = gets.chomp

# print 'Enter a verb: '
# verb = gets.chomp

# print 'Enter an adjective: '
# adjective = gets.chomp

# print 'Enter an adverb: '
# adverb = gets.chomp

# sentence_1 = "Do you #{verb} your #{adjective} #{noun} #{adverb}? That's
# hilarious!"
# sentence_2 = "The #{adjective} #{noun} #{verb}s #{adverb} over the lazy dog."
# sentence_3 = "The #{noun} #{adverb} #{verb}s up #{adjective} Joe's turtle."

# puts [sentence_1, sentence_2, sentence_3].sample

# Discussion
# Using string interpolation here instead of concatenation makes it more
# readable and is generally considered more rubyish (especially given that it is
# a sentence).

# The different madlib sentences are written within our Ruby file. Another
# option here, one that is a bit more complicated, would be to read in a text
# file. Then, we could use String#format to interpolate our noun, verb,
# adjective, and adverb into this file.
