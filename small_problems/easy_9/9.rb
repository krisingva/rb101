# Write a method that determines the mean (average) of the three scores passed
# to it, and returns the letter value associated with that grade.

# Numerical Score Letter	Grade
# 90 <= score <= 100	'A'
# 80 <= score < 90	'B'
# 70 <= score < 80	'C'
# 60 <= score < 70	'D'
# 0 <= score < 60	'F'
# Tested values are all between 0 and 100. There is no need to check for
# negative values or values greater than 100.

def get_grade(num1, num2, num3)
  average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3
  case average
  when 90..100 then'A'
  when 80..89  then'B'
  when 70..79  then'C'
  when 60..69  then'D'

  end
end

# LS:

# Solution
# def get_grade(s1, s2, s3)
#   result = (s1 + s2 + s3)/3

#   case result
#   when 90..100 then 'A'
#   when 80..89  then 'B'
#   when 70..79  then 'C'
#   when 60..69  then 'D'
#   else              'F'
#   end
# end

# Discussion
# The result is just the average of the three scores. The case statement does a
# comparison on it. This takes advantage of the fact that the comparison used by
# the case statement returns true if the range includes the other object
# (essentially calling (range).include?(other_object).

# You can therefore read it as

# when (90..100).include?(result)

# Further exploration
# How would you handle this if there was a possibility of extra credit grades
# causing it to exceed 100 points?

# Change the range for grade 'A' to become 90.. (goes to infinity)

# Example:

p get_grade(95, 90, 93) == "A"
p get_grade(50, 50, 95) == "D"
