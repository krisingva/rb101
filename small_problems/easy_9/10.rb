# Solution
# Solution 1

# def buy_fruit(list)
#   expanded_list = []

#   list.each do |item|
#     fruit, quantity = item[0], item[1]
#     quantity.times { expanded_list << fruit }
#   end

#   expanded_list
# end

# Solution 2

# def buy_fruit(list)
#   list.map { |fruit, quantity| [fruit] * quantity }.flatten
# end

# Discussion
# In the first solution, we define a new array expanded_list and then iterate
# over the array passed in as an argument. For each subarray, we grab the
# quantity and the name of the fruit by using index reference and push each
# string the required number of times into our new array. We use the
# Integer#times method in order to execute the content of the block for the
# number of times specified by the caller, here quantity. On each iteration the
# block is executed and the fruit string is appended to our expanded list.

# Note that we could use the block parameters to access each element of the
# subarrays, like this:

# list.each do |fruit, quantity|
#   quantity.times { expanded_list << fruit }
# end

#   The second solution is more compact. We choose to use map in order to return
#   a transformation of the array passed in as an argument. Here again we use
#   the block parameters to access each element of the subarrays. We realize
#   that we want to multiply each fruit by the given quantity, and try this:

# fruit * quantity => "applesapplesapples"
# This is not exactly what we want! We are doing string concatenation when in
# fact we want an array containing the required quantity of each fruit as
# separate strings. Let's try something else:

# [fruit] * quantity => ["apples", "apples", "apples"]
# Great! We are almost done. We now have an array containing all of our fruits
# in nested subarrays:

# [["apples", "apples", "apples"], ["orange"], ["bananas", "bananas"]]
# All we need is Array#flatten to reduce it down to a single large array.

# Example:

p buy_fruit([["apples", 3], ["orange", 1], ["bananas", 2]]) ==
  ["apples", "apples", "apples", "orange", "bananas","bananas"]
