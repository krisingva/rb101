# Write a method that takes a string as an argument, and returns an Array that
# contains every word from the string, to which you have appended a space and
# the word length.

# You may assume that words in the string are separated by exactly one space,
# and that any substring of non-space characters is a word.

def word_lengths(str)
  str.split.map do |word|
    word << " " << "#{word.size - 1}"
  end
end

# LS:
# Solution
# def word_lengths(string)
#   words = string.split

#   words.map do |word|
#     word + ' ' + word.length.to_s
#   end
# end

# Discussion
# Let's take it step by step. First we want to split the separate words into an
# array:

# irb(main):001:0> string = "cow sheep chicken"
# => "cow sheep chicken"
# irb(main):002:0> string.split
# => ["cow", "sheep", "chicken"]
# We store this word array in a wordsvariable. Then we realize we need to modify
# each word separately, that is to transform our words array. This is a good use
# case for Array#map. Remember that map will return a new array, of the same
# size as the caller array, with each element replaced according to the return
# value of the block. Let's test this out with a simple example:

# irb(main):003:0> ["cow", "sheep", "chicken"].map { |word| word + '!' }
# => ["cow!", "sheep!", "chicken!"]
# This is close, but not exactly what we want. We can use string concatenation
# to combine the word with its length. Remember that the length will be an
# integer and needs to be converted to a string before you can concatenate them.

# We could also use string interpolation and method chaining to solve this
# problem in one line:

# def word_lengths(string)
#   string.split.map { |word| "#{word} #{word.length}" }
# end

# Examples

p word_lengths("cow sheep chicken") == ["cow 3", "sheep 5", "chicken 7"]

p word_lengths("baseball hot dogs and apple pie") ==
  ["baseball 8", "hot 3", "dogs 4", "and 3", "apple 5", "pie 3"]

p word_lengths("It ain't easy, is it?") == ["It 2", "ain't 5", "easy, 5", "is 2", "it? 3"]

p word_lengths("Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious") ==
  ["Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 34"]

p word_lengths("") == []
