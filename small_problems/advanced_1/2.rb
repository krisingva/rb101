# Seeing Stars
# Write a method that displays an 8-pointed star in an nxn grid, where n is an
# odd integer that is supplied as an argument to the method. The smallest such
# star you need to handle is a 7x7 grid.

def star(int)
  star_space = (int - 3) / 2
  begin_space = 0
  (int/2).times do
    puts "#{' ' * begin_space}*#{' ' * star_space}*#{' ' * star_space}*#{' ' * begin_space}"
    star_space -= 1
    begin_space += 1
  end
  middle = "*" * int
  puts middle
  (int/2).times do
    star_space += 1
    begin_space -= 1
    puts "#{' ' * begin_space}*#{' ' * star_space}*#{' ' * star_space}*#{' ' * begin_space}"
  end
end

# LS:
# Solution
# def print_row(grid_size, distance_from_center)
#   number_of_spaces = distance_from_center - 1
#   spaces = ' ' * number_of_spaces
#   output = Array.new(3, '*').join(spaces)
#   puts output.center(grid_size)
# end

# def star(grid_size)
#   max_distance = (grid_size - 1) / 2
#   max_distance.downto(1) { |distance| print_row(grid_size, distance) }
#   puts '*' * grid_size
#   1.upto(max_distance)   { |distance| print_row(grid_size, distance) }
# end

# Discussion
# This problem is nearly identical to an earlier problem in the Medium section,
# Diamonds, though the results look a bit different. The solution itself is very
# similar, so should be easy to understand if you understood the previous
# solution. There are two differences of note.

# The first difference occurs in the main method, which we call star in our
# solution. In diamond, we didn't need any special handling for the middle row
# of our diamond since it fit the same pattern of the rows above and below it.
# This is not the case with our star, so we have to handle the middle line
# separately. Fortunately, this is easy to do.

# The other difference is in print_row. Here we take a slightly different route
# to constructing the output string, though in the end we do exactly the same
# thing by printing the row centered within the grid size.

# Further Exploration What other patterns can you come up with that can be
# produced in similar ways to the patterns of this exercise? Can you draw a
# reasonable looking circle? How about a sine wave?
