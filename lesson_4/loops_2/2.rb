# Modify the following code so that the loop stops if number is equal to or
# between 0 and 10.

# loop do
#   number = rand(100)
#   puts number
# end

arr = (0..10).to_a
loop do
  number = rand(100)
  puts number
  break if arr.include?(number)
end

# LS
# Solution
# loop do
#   number = rand(100)
#   puts number

#   if number.between?(0, 10)
#     break
#   end
# end
# Discussion
#     Inside the loop, we're assigning a random integer to number upon each
#     iteration. Our goal for this exercise is to create a condition that stops
#     the loop if number is equal to or between 0 and 10. There are a couple
#     ways we could have implemented this, however, we chose to use the
#     Comparable#between? method. #between? takes two arguments and returns a
#     boolean, true or false, if the caller's value is between the two integers
#     provided. In this case, we use it in an if condition that will execute
#     break when #between? returns true.
