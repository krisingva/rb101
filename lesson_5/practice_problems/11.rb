# Given the following data structure use a combination of methods, including
# either the select or reject method, to return a new array identical in
# structure to the original but containing only the integers that are multiples
# of 3.

arr = [[2], [3, 5, 7], [9], [11, 13, 15]]

new_arr = arr.map do |subarr|
  subarr.select do |num|
    num % 3 == 0
  end
end

p new_arr

# LS:
# arr.map do |element|
#   element.select do |num|
#     num % 3 == 0
#   end
# end
# # => [[], [3], [9], [15]]

# We know that we want to return a new array, so map is a good choice to call on
# the original array. Technically you could use either select or reject for the
# nested arrays as both would work, however choosing to use select makes the
# code a bit more readable. This is what the same solution would look like with
# reject:

# arr.map do |element|
#   element.reject do |num|
#     num % 3 != 0
#   end
# end
# # => [[], [3], [9], [15]]

# Since the method rejects elements based on the truthiness of the evaluated
# condition, combining reject with the != operator seems somewhat like a double
# negative and is more difficult to parse than select combined with ==.
