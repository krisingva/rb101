# Sorting nested data structures can be tricky, and it is important to be clear
# about the level at which you are sorting and which values you want to use to
# order your collection.

# Say for example we have an array of nested arrays which contain numeric
# strings, and we want to sort the outer array so that the inner arrays are
# ordered according to the numeric value of the strings they contain. Take, for
# example, the following 4-element array of arrays.

arr = [['1', '8', '11'], ['2', '6', '13'], ['2', '12', '15'], ['1', '8', '9']]

# We know that we want to sort at the level of the outer array, but we can't
# simply call sort on it. When sorting nested arrays it is important to
# understand that there are two sets of comparison happening:

# Each of the inner arrays is compared with the other inner arrays.
# The way those arrays are compared is by comparing the elements within them
# (the documentation refers to this as comparing in an 'element-wise' manner)
# Because the elements in the arrays are strings, by calling sort it is string
# order which will ultimately determine array order:

arr.sort # => [["1", "8", "11"], ["1", "8", "9"], ["2", "12", "15"], ["2", "6", "13"]]

# Since strings are compared character by character this doesn't give us a
# numerical comparison. In order to achieve this we have to perform some
# transformation on the inner arrays prior to comparing them.

arr.sort_by do |sub_arr|
  sub_arr.map do |num|
    num.to_i
  end
end
# => [["1", "8", "9"], ["1", "8", "11"], ["2", "6", "13"], ["2", "12", "15"]]

# What is happening here?

# The key here is understanding that when we carry out transformation within a
# sort_by block, the transformed elements are what are then used to perform the
# comparison. As long as what is returned by the block is comparable, we can
# perform whatever transformation we need to within the block - including
# nesting other method calls within it.

# In this case, each time the top-level block is called, we call map on the
# sub-array for that iteration, within the map block we call to_i on each string
# within that particular sub-array, which returns a new array with integers and
# leaves the original sub-array unmodified. This ends up sorting the outer array
# by comparing the transformed integers in the inner arrays, which is what we're
# looking to do, without any side effects.
